                    Data is a dream
                        Living in digital space
                            Untouched it goes stale

From Shakespearean Couplets to Japanese Haikus, the number of lines and syllables are often used to structure a poem.

In this metaphor, the words are the data to be structured by the form of the poem.

This is an All Class lab -- we're all collaborating on the same project together! Because of that we need to be mindful of others, both in choosing inoffensive words to share, and in being mindful of merge conflicts. Follow the instructions closely so you can avoid causing great pain for yourself or your fellow classmates!

Part 1: Individual

Create a class that *implements* the interface Words. To create a class, be sure explorer is selected, then select "New File..." Name your file YourName.java replacing YourName with your name.

Implement the method phrase any way you'd like, so long as it's able to return a string of syllables from 1 to 5 in length, inclusive. Some common ways to do this: if statements, case statements, or an array.

Once you've implemented your interface, open Main.java and add your class to the wordsList. *IMPORTANT* Only change the line associated with the number you have been assigned for this lab. This is to prevent merge conflicts since everyone in the class will be using the same file! 

Once you have completed this step, Commit your code to github by selecting source control, then typing a message in the commit box, and then selecting Commit. You may be asked to sync, pull, and push with Git. 

The commit button will be unselectable when successful.

Part 2: Group

Find one or two fellow creators to collaborate with. Together, decide on a poem format. Use the internet to reasearch different styles, but simple is probably better for this lab, as we're going to be limited on words available.

Once a style has been decided, select one workstation for the group to collaborate from. Take turns having one collaborator to DPS the code by typing. Select another collaborator to Tank the concepts by calling the components to convert from the plan to the code. If there is a third collaborator, Support the effort by verifying the lines of code. Every few minutes switch roles.

As a group, create a class that *extends* the abstract class Structure. Use your team's initials to name the class: ABC.java replacing ABC with your initials.

Implement the abstract methods from Structure in your new class. Use existing helper methods if you'd like. Within your displayPoem method, use System.out.println() to display your poems lines.

You can add your ABC.java class to the Main.java, replacing the letter that you have been assigned. This will allow you to test your structure by running the program. When your group is satisfied with your structure, commit your code!

Part 3: We'll have a chaotic randomly generated poem reading in class!
